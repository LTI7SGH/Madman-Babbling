跟苏兄1:1之前的30min，突然发现Juan M.B.离职了，忽然有种格雷兄弟不要坑我的恐慌。
但是抱着已经下定的决心，将想要转组的想法和盘托出，开启了苏兄的疯狂挽留模式。

###我忘了他就是Incident Team过来的，他的论点如下：
1. Incident team has a much smaller problem scope. No leadership, no clear roadmap, not much to do. 
2. Every MBA graduate wants to join McKinsey, because they want to work with the smartest people. Move up or out, although with the toughest competition, people grow faster as well. He thinks NM has a much higher bar and better talents. 
3. He feels sad that all the investment in my technical skills are about to paid off while I wanted to leave now. 
4. He wants me to deliver the RLF Model, he thinks I'm worried about delievering the outputs so that wanted to take a clean cut. 

###他的挽留如下：
1. He can try to create as many career opportunities for me as possible, which includes:
   1) Exposure to other fuctions with NM, co-work on other projects.
   2) Get more visibilities with leadership team. Raj recognizes my contribution and benchmark me as a good analyst: is he good as Tiantian?
   3) Better work life balance (He admits that he piled a lot of work on me and should have seen this coming). He suggests me to take a break, 1~2 weeks as needed. 
   4) Promotion: 1.5 year to become a manager. 
2. He will try to create or find roles for me within Network Management or other orgs. 
他的诉求：postpone it for 6 months.

###What do I want?
salary
career development: communication

Take a break, think about it. Stay on the team, be clear about what you'll be working on. And keep looking for other opportunities.
不要着急，可能还是太着急了一点。XY说的对，找工作也许不需要花什么时间，每天看看，有了合适的就投。

多focus在自己的职业成长上，搞清楚自己的目标，多研究其它行业和公司，多network，了解不同的岗位做什么。找一份好工作需要时间。不要太着急挣钱的事情，不是少挣一年，是晚挣一年钱。妈的，颜巷陋阮途穷，你怎么变成了这种人？！

All men live, and all men die. Make use of your life!
